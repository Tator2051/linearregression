# linearregression
This is a personal project that I did while I was studying Statistics and Linear Regressions. 
I studied the math of a linear regression and used Python to create a template that calculates some features like Pearson Coefficient and Linear Equation.

Uses:
Python
  Pandas
  Numpy
  Matplotlib
  Statistics
  Scikitlearn

You can find:
  - Manual maths calculations
  - Automatic calculations by Scikitlearn
